# Checklist de Acessibilidade para aplicações móveis

## Design for smaller screens

The mobile experience introduces screens that are much smaller than desktop and laptop computers. Because mobile users are reading and interacting with content with limited screen space, the information needs to be displayed thoughtfully and all interactivity needs to consider the smaller sizes of touch targets.

[ ] The amount of content displayed at a time is reasonable
[ ] Buttons and controls are large enough to view and select by touch
[ ] Buttons and controls have enough inactive space around them so neighboring controls aren’t selected by mistake
[ ] Form fields are positioned below their labels
